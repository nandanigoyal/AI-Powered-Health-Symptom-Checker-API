# AI-Powered Health Symptom Checker API

## Overview

The Health Symptom Checker API allows users to enter their symptoms and get AI-driven predictions for possible medical conditions. The system utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze user inputs and provide recommendations for common health conditions. This project aims to help users understand their symptoms better and potentially seek medical advice.

The API is built using **FastAPI** and **TensorFlow/PyTorch** for the AI model. It supports basic symptom tracking and condition prediction based on the user's inputs.

## Features

1. **Symptom Input:**
   - Users can input their symptoms and receive an analysis based on AI predictions.

2. **AI-Driven Condition Prediction:**
   - The API uses an AI model to predict possible medical conditions based on the symptoms provided.

3. **Health Recommendations:**
   - Provides recommendations for further steps based on predicted conditions (e.g., "consult a doctor", "rest at home").

4. **Historical Data:**
   - Optionally, the user can maintain a log of their symptoms over time for trend analysis.

## Requirements

- **FastAPI**: For building the API endpoints.
- **Uvicorn**: For running the FastAPI app.
- **TensorFlow/PyTorch**: For AI/ML model implementation.
- **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **sklearn**: For machine learning model training.
- **SQLite/PostgreSQL**: For storing symptom logs (optional).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/health-symptom-checker-api.git
   cd health-symptom-checker-api
